Description
Given the schema presented below write a query, which uses a window function, that returns two most viewed posts for every category.

Order the result set by:

category name alphabetically
number of post views largest to lowest
post id lowest to largest
Note:
Some categories may have less than two or no posts at all.
Two or more posts within the category can be tied by (have the same) the number of views. Use post id as a tie breaker - a post with a lower id gets a higher rank.

SELECT 
  c.id AS "category_id", 
  c.category, 
  t.title AS "title", 
  t.views AS "views", 
  t.id AS "post_id"
FROM (
   SELECT *,
          RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY p.category_id ORDER BY views DESC, p.id) AS rank
   FROM posts p
) AS t RIGHT JOIN categories c on (t.category_id = c.id)
WHERE COALESCE(rank, 0) <= 2
ORDER BY c.category, t.views DESC, post_id;
