Task
Given the information about sales in a store, calculate the total revenue for each day, month, year, and product.

Notes:
Order the result by the product_name, year, month, day columns
We're interested only in the product-specific data, so you shouldn't return the total revenue from all sales

SELECT
  name AS product_name,
  EXTRACT(year from date)::int AS year,
  EXTRACT(month from date)::int AS month,
  EXTRACT(day from date)::int AS day,
  SUM(price * count) AS total
FROM sales_details sd
JOIN sales s ON sd.sale_id = s.id
JOIN products p ON sd.product_id = p.id
GROUP BY name, rollup(year, month, day)
ORDER BY product_name, year, month, day;
